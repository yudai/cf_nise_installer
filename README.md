# Cloud Foundry v2 Nise Installer

## Devbox Installer with Nise BOSH and nise-bosh-vagrant

CF Nise Installer is a set of scripts that installs a Cloud Foundry v2 instance to your single machine or Vagrant VM. You can build your own 'devbox' quickly by running a single command with this installer.

CF Nise Installer is based on [cf-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release) by Pivotal, [Nise BOSH](http://github.com/nttlabs/nise_bosh/) by NTT Laboratory and [nise-bosh-vagrant](https://github.com/BrianMMcClain/nise-bosh-vagrant) by Brian McClain.

## Building Devbox on Single Server

This section shows you how to install CF components to your server.

If you want to build a devbox on a Vagrant VM, skip this section and see the next section.

### Requirements

* Ubuntu 10.04 64bit
   * *Ubuntu 12.04 is not supported*
* 8GB+ free HDD space
* 4GB+ memory
   * m1.medium or larger instance is recommended on AWS

### *NOTICE*

The latest cf-release has a problem on provisioning service instances.

Use the older revision `ea61ec6f8f` of cf-release by setting the `CF_RELEASE_BRANCH` environment variable or revert the revision `03af1d4` in `src/cloud_controller_ng` manually.


### Installing Cloud Foundry Components

Run the commands below on your server:

```sh
sudo apt-get install curl
bash < <(curl -s -k -B https://raw.github.com/yudai/cf_nise_installer/master/local/bootstrap.sh)
```

The `bootstrap.sh` script installs everything needed for your devbox. This command may take a couple of hours at first run.

You need to restart your server once after the installation is completed.

### Launching Processes

You can start the processes for your devbox by running the following command in the `cf_nise_installer` directory cloned by the `bootstrap.sh` script:

```sh
./local/start_processes.sh
```

This command launches the Monit process and then start up all monit jobs installed by Nise BOSH.

You can also manually manage the processes with the Monit command:

```sh
# Start Monit
sudo /var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit
# Launch `all` processes
sudo /var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit start all
# See status
sudo /var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit status
sudo /var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit summary # shorter
# Stop `all` processes
sudo /var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit stop all
```

Confirm all the processes shown by `monit summary` indicate `running`. It takes a few minutes to initialize all processes.

### Update Existing Devbox

To update your existing Devbox, you can use scripts in the `local` directory. You don't need to execute the `bootstrap.sh` script for this purpose.

* clone_cf_release.sh
  * Clones `cf-release` repository
  * When the `cf-release` directory exists, does nothing.
* launch_nise_bosh.sh
  * Executes Nise BOSH and update installation
* postinstall.sh
  * Runs some commands to work the CF instance properly
  * Required to be executed after the `launch_nise_bosh.sh`
* start_processes.sh
  * Invokes the Monit process and CF processes
* register_service_tokens.sh
  * Registers required tokens for services
  * Required to be executed *once* after launching processes
* install.sh
  * Runs the above scripts in order
  * Executes some additional tasks such as installing Ruby, Gems and Nise Bosh

These scripts do not automatically update existing files in the `cf-release` and `nise_bosh` directories. You need to update them if needed.

When run these scrips ts, be sure your are  in the `cf_nise_installer` directory, and not in `local` directory.

### Environment Variables

You can customize your installation using environment variables.

| Name              | Description                              | Used in                                 | Default                                        |

| INSTALLER_BRANCH  | Branch/Revision for cf_nise_installer    | bootstrap.sh                            | master                                         |

| CF_RELEASE_BRANCH | Branch/Revision for cf-release           | clone_cf_release.sh                     | master                                         |
| NISE_IP_ADDRESS   | IP address to bind CF components         | install.sh, register_service_tokens.sh  | Automatically detected using `ip` command      |
| NISE_DOMAIN       | Domain name for the devbox               | launch_nise_bosh.sh                     | *nil* (<ip_address>.xip.io)                    |

## Build Devbox with Vagrant

You can create a devbox VM quickly with Vagrant and [nise-bosh-vagrant](https://github.com/BrianMMcClain/nise-bosh-vagrant).

#### Requirements

* Vagrant 1.2 or later
* Ruby 1.9.3-p392 (Required by cf-release)
* 8GB+ free HDD space
* 4GB+ free memory

### Launch Vagrant VM with CF components

Run the following command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install curl
bash < <(curl -s -k -B https://raw.github.com/yudai/cf_nise_installer/master/vagrant/bootstrap.sh)
```
Once the command is finished, you can target your devbox and push applications.

### Updating Devbox

To update your existing devbox, you can use scripts in the `vagrant` directory.

* clone_cf_release.sh
  * Clones `cf-release` repository
  * When the `cf-release` directory exists, does nothing.
* launch_nise_bosh.sh
  * Launch a new Vagrant VM and executes Nise BOSH in the VM
  * Destroy the existing VM before running this script
* postinstall.sh
  * Runs some commands to work the CF instance properly
  * Required to be executed after the `launch_nise_bosh.sh`
* start_processes.sh
  * Invokes the Monit process and CF processes
* register_service_tokens.sh
  * Registers required tokens for services
  * Required to be executed *once* after launching processes
* install.sh
  * Runs the above scripts in order

These scripts do not automatically update existing files in the `cf-release` and `nise_bosh` directories. You need to update them if needed.

When run these scripts, be sure your are  in the `cf_nise_installer` directory, and not in `vagrant` directory.

You can destroy your existing VM and delete generated files with the following commands:

```sh
cd cf-release
vagrant destroy && rm -rf .nise-bosh-* Vagrantfile .vagrant
```

When you want to update CF components without rebuilding your VM itself, you can SSH into your VM and re-run the Nise BOSH.

```
cd cf-release
vagrant ssh
# in the VM
./install_release.sh
```

### Environment Variables

You can customize your installation using environment variables.

| Name              | Description                              | Used in                                 | Default                                        |
| :---------------: | :--------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------: |
| INSTALLER_URL     | URI for cf_nise_installer                | bootstrap.sh                            | https://github.com/yudai/cf_nise_installer.git |
| INSTALLER_BRANCH  | Branch/Revision for cf_nise_installer    | bootstrap.sh                            | master                                         |
| CF_RELEASE_URL    | URI for cf-release                       | clone_cf_release.sh                     | https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release.git |
| CF_RELEASE_BRANCH | Branch/Revision for cf-release           | clone_cf_release.sh                     | master                                        |
| NISE_IP_ADDRESS   | IP address for the VM. When this variable is set, the attached network will be bridged  | launch_nise_bosh.sh, register_service_tokens.sh | *nil* (192.168.10.10, not bridged) |
| VAGRANT_MEMORY    | Memory size for the VM                   | launch_nise_bosh.sh                     | 4096                                           |
| NISE_DOMAIN       | Domain name for the devbox               | launch_nise_bosh.sh                     | *nil* (<ip_address>.xip.io)                    |

## Playing with installed Devbox

You can target and login to your installed devbox using following values:


| Target URI     | api.\<IP Address\>.xip.io | api.192.168.10.10.xip.io |
| :------------: | :-----------------------: | :----------------------: |
| Admin User     | micro@vcap.me             | <-                       |
| Admin Password | micr0@micr0               | <-                       |

When you installed your devbox with Vagrant, you can access your devbox only from the host machine that runs the VM.

'[xip.io](http://xip.io/)' is a DNS service provided by 37signals that returns the IP address specified in the subdomain of FQDNs.

### Service token registration

To create services, you need to register tokens to UAA.

With the Vagrant setup, this step is automatically done. You need to run the following command only when you installed your devbox on your local machine.

```sh
./local/register_stervice_tokens.sh
```
